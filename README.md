## A lab topology based on MPLS in the SDN era book used for 300-535 SPAUTO studies

[Cisco Certified DevNet Specialist - Service Provider Automation and Programmability](https://developer.cisco.com/certification/devnet-sp-auto/)

### Why MPLS in the SDN Era?

Simple. This is an incredible book for any and all Network Engineers interested
in learning technologies used in Service Provider environments. The book is heavily focused
on MPLS, SDN, Segment-Routing, BGP, L2VPN/L3VPNs, over-all traffic engineering and much more. These are common terms within SP networks and the book does an incredible job in guiding the readers while exploring the device configurations in this topology. However, many other topics are not covered by the book and this repository will hopefully fill in the gaps. This book lays the foundation for our lab topology, but it has increased and grown over time. Additional material used for studying is the book `Network Programmability with YANG`, which covers a lot of the topics in the blueprint!

![MPLS IN THE SDN ERA](./docs/images/mpls_sdn_era_topology.png)

This book goes through a number of device configurations in a multi-vendor lab topology
(Cisco IOSXR && Juniper). However, *For this lab, all devices have been replaced with Cisco-IOSXR/XE as we are working on a Cisco Certification.*

### To fully automate Service Provider Networks, you must understand Service Provider Networks

[MPLS in the SDN Era](https://www.amazon.com/MPLS-SDN-Era-Interoperable-Scenarios/dp/149190545X/ref=sr_1_1?dchild=1&keywords=mpls+in+the+sdn+era&qid=1618100065&s=books&sr=1-1)

[Network Programmability with YANG](https://www.amazon.com/Network-Programmability-YANG-Modeling-driven-Management/dp/0135180392)

## What does this repository include & cover

My goal is to gather all of my self-training in this repository and cover all the topics of the 
Cisco Certified DevNet Specialist (300-535 SPAUTO) certification.

## How can I use this repo to study?

I recommend you read the documentation and additionally, take advantage of the ContainerLab topology provided. Use and abuse the topology. Destroy and rebuild. Learn by breaking!

Go ahead and start the topology using ContainerLab and have fun automating the network!

30% of the SPAUTO exam is around Automation and Orchestration platforms, such as NSO. I can't stress enough the importance of taking the time to setup an NSO instance to explore and take advantage of the many examples in this repository. Containerizing NSO for CI/CD is also part of the blueprint, which we will cover.

## Recommended Study Material & Resources

    - MPLS in the SDN Era (Book)
    - Network Programmability with YANG (Book)
    - Nicholas Russo DevNet Material (Pluralsight)

## Container Lab

After exploring [ContainerLab](https://containerlab.srlinux.dev/), I have begun to move away from EVE-NG and completely dockerized this topology. Initially, I thought I would share an exported lab from EVE-NG, but including the CLAB topology in this lab makes it so much more portable.

I've created a simple to use docker-compose service to start the lab. ContainerLab it's self is pulled down as a docker container, so you don't need a local installation of ContainerLab unless you want to have one. I recommend you deploy this lab in a Linux environment, as docker virtualization will prevent you from starting in a Mac or Windows env.

### Requirements

- Docker
- Docker Compose
- Roughly 32Gb of available RAM

### Starting Lab

Simply run the service using docker-compose

```bash
docker-compose run clab
```

You should see something similar to this

```

This will start a lab topology for you and all the devices should be accessible via SSH/NETCONF/gNMI. The topology YAML file has been crafted with a custom Docker Management Network to statically assign the IP's to each node as well. This network is reserved under 172.100.100.0/24. From your local machine, after starting the devices, you should be able to ssh into each one.

You will know the lab has been successfully started once all devices show healthy state. Validate via docker command

```
docker ps
```

The status should say (healthy)

### Load Configurations

Unfortunately, these vrnetlab based nodes don't support providing a startup-config via ContainerLab. However, I've provided a Nornir job to simply deploy all the configs to each one of the devices.

After starting the lab and waiting around 7 Minutes, launch off the Nornir script to deploy the configurations.

Install the project venv

```
poetry install
```

Activate venv

```
poetry shell
```

Locate the Nornir playground

```
cd spauto/spauto_nornir
```

Automate

```
python nr_deploy_configs.py
```

>>> NOTE: If you have issues with `no matching key exchange method found, add the below line to `~/.ssh/config`

```bash
Ciphers aes256-cbc,aes128-ctr,aes192-ctr,aes256-ctr,aes128-cbc,3des-cbc 
KexAlgorithms +diffie-hellman-group1-sha1
```
### Destroying the lab

To destroy the lab, simply override the docker-compose service command and destroy it.

```
docker-compose run clab containerlab destroy -t spauto-topology.yml
```

```

## NSO

A pre-packaged NSO Docker container is available. This will be a fresh docker container with the following NEDs:

```text
cisco-ios-cli-6.69
cisco-iosxr-cli-7.33
```

To spin up the NSO instance

```
docker-compose up -d nso
```

To access via UI (admin/admin) get the IP address of the NSO instance and open it in your browser

```
docker inspect --format='{{range .NetworkSettings.Networks}}{{.IPAddress}}{{end}}'
```

If you want to simply ssh from the same machine that's hosting the container

```
ssh admin@localhost -p 2024
```

The docker-compose service is mapping port 2024 to 22.
